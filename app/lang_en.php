The client of the salon demanded to compensate her for material and moral damage in the amount of 60 thousand UAH.
 The plaintiff claimed that after the procedure she had received a burn on the skin, which relates to minor bodily 
 injuries, in support of which she attached medical documents with conclusions to the suit.
In the lawsuit, the complainant complained that the information about the procedure did not correspond to the company's
 commercial on YouTube about the procedure, as well as that the company did not convey to it information about possible
  complications from the procedure, etc.
The salon in court claimed that the client was self-medicating, could violate the post-procedural regime prescribed by
 the salon specialist, which could have caused an undesirable result from the procedure.
In court, I cited a number of evidence about the lack of violation of consumer rights by the salon, as well as the
 absence of guilt in the actions of salon specialists and the causal link between their actions and consequences.
The court of first instance partially ruled in favor of the plaintiff and ordered compensation in the amount of 5
 thousand UAH. At the same time, the judgment did not determine what exactly the salon violated.
In the interests of the salon an appeal was filed, based on the results of consideration of which the Court of
 appeal fully satisfied it and found the plaintiff’s claims to the salon unfounded.");

In the court I stated the legal position that being abroad and not knowing about the death of the testator
 is not a valid reason for missing the deadline for accepting the inheritance. Moreover, consular offices 
 have the right to perform the functions of a notary abroad, which means the plaintiff has not executed
  her right to accept the inheritance.
The courts of first and appeal instances sided with the clients and indicated that being abroad and not

The case was complicated by the fact that earlier the court had already denied the client exemption from criminal

responsibility due to the expiration of the statute of limitations. The court also declared illegal the suspension
